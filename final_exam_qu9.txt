FINAL: QUESTION 9

Now that the config server from question #8 is up and running, we will restore the two shards ("s1" and "s2").

If we inspect our restored config db, we see this in db.shards:

~/dba/final $ mongo localhost:27019/config
MongoDB shell version: 3.0.0
connecting to: localhost:27019/config
configsvr> db.shards.find()
{ "_id" : "s1", "host" : "s1/genome_svr1:27501,genome_svr2:27502,genome_svr2:27503" }
{ "_id" : "s2", "host" : "s2/genome_svr4:27601,genome_svr5:27602,genome_svr5:27603" }
From this we know when we run a mongos for the cluster, it will expect the first shard to be a replica set named "s1", and the second to be a replica set named "s2", and also to be able to be able to resolve and connect to at least one of the seed hostnames for each shard.

If we were restoring this cluster as "itself", it would be best to assign the hostnames "genome_svr1" etc. to the appropriate IP addresses in DNS, and not change config.shard. However, for this problem, our job is not to restore the cluster, but rather to create a new temporary data mart initialized with this dataset.

Thus instead we will update the config.shards metadata to point to the locations of our new shard servers. Update the config.shards collection such that your output is:

configsvr> db.shards.find()
{ "_id" : "s1", "host" : "localhost:27501" }
{ "_id" : "s2", "host" : "localhost:27601" }
configsvr> 
Be sure when you do this nothing is running except the single config server. mongod and mongos processes cache metadata, so this is important. After the update restart the config server itself for the same reason.

Now start a mongod for each shard -- one on port 27501 for shard "s1" and on port 27601 for shard "s2". At this point if you run ps you should see three mongod's -- one for each shard, and one for our config server. Note they need not be replica sets, but just regular mongod's, as we did not begin our host string in config.shards with setname/. Finally, use mongorestore to restore the data for each shard.

The next step is to start a mongos for the cluster.

Connect to the mongos with a mongo shell. Run this:

use snps
var x = db.elegans.aggregate( [ { $match : { N2 : "T" } } , { $group : { _id:"$N2" , n : { $sum : 1 } } } ] ).next(); print( x.n )
Enter the number output for n.

Notes:

You must do this with MongoDB 3.0. The mongoimport may not work with prior versions of MongoDB.

 ANSWER

               As expected, when we look in the shards directory, we see the two documents representing the shards:

               $ mongo localhost:27019/config
               MongoDB shell version: 3.0.0
               connecting to: localhost:27019/config
               configsvr> db.shards.find()
               { "_id" : "s1", "host" : "s1/genome_svr1:27501,genome_svr2:27502,genome_svr2:27503" }
               { "_id" : "s2", "host" : "s2/genome_svr4:27601,genome_svr5:27602,genome_svr5:27603" }
               Our first task will be to update these documents.

               configsvr> var s1 = db.shards.findOne( { _id : "s1" } )
               configsvr> var s2 = db.shards.findOne( { _id : "s2" } )
               configsvr> s1.host = "localhost:27501"
               localhost:27501
               configsvr> s2.host = "localhost:27601"
               localhost:27601
               configsvr> db.shards.save(s1)
               WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })
               configsvr> db.shards.save(s2)
               WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })
               configsvr> db.shards.find()
               { "_id" : "s1", "host" : "localhost:27501" }
               { "_id" : "s2", "host" : "localhost:27601" }
               configsvr>
               OK, let's kill that process and start up our shards.

               ps ax | grep mongo | grep 27019 | read cfgProcessId otherStuff
               kill $cfgProcessId
               OK, let's start up our servers and load them with data.

               mongod --dbpath temp_mart/s1 --logpath temp_mart/s1.log --port 27501 --fork
               mongod --dbpath temp_mart/s2 --logpath temp_mart/s2.log --port 27601 --fork
               mongorestore --port 27501 gene_backup/s1
               mongorestore --port 27601 gene_backup/s2
               Next, we'll start our config server back up, and then spin up a mongos.

               mongod --dbpath temp_mart/cfg --logpath temp_mart/cfg.log --fork --port 27019 --configsvr
               mongos --configdb localhost:27019 --logpath temp_mart/mongos.log --fork
               mongo
               mongos> sh.status() // see what our cluster looks like
               mongos> use snps
               mongos> var x = db.elegans.aggregate( [ { $match : { N2 : "T" } } , { $group : { _id:"$N2" , n : { $sum : 1 } } } ] ).next(); print( x.n )
               47664
               And now we have demonstrated that we've set up our cluster.
