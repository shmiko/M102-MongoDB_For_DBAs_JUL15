FINAL: QUESTION 4

Keep the three member replica set from the above problems running. We've had a request to make the third member never eligible to be primary. (The member should still be visible as a secondary.)

Reconfigure the replica set so that the third member can never be primary. Then run:

$ mongo --shell a.js --port 27003
And run:

> part4()
And enter the result in the text box below (with no spaces or line feeds just the exact value returned).

ANSWER: 233

ANSWER NOTES

This problem has been changed slightly from the original that Dwight was working from, so it now has an arbiter (previously, it used 3 full members). You'll see the difference in rs.conf(), when it will probably be (for you):

{
	"_id" : "z",
	"version" : 2,
	"members" : [
		{
			"_id" : 1,
			"host" : "localhost:27001"
		},
		{
			"_id" : 2,
			"host" : "localhost:27002",
			"arbiterOnly" : true
		},
		{
			"_id" : 3,
			"host" : "localhost:27003",
			"priority" : 0
		}
	]
}
Other than this, though, the answer remains completely correct.
